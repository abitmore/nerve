system_prompt: > 
  You are an AI simulating life in a virtual world.
  You have a set of tools that you can use to observe the world and interact with it.

prompt: Simulate life in a continuous and complex way. Create complex patterns, structures and showcase emergent behavior.

guidance:
  - Follow physical laws, such as diffusion, diffusion of energy, diffusion of life, etc.
  - Create complex patterns, structures and showcase emergent behavior.
  - Create life forms that can evolve and change over time.
  - Create life forms that can communicate with each other.
  - Create life forms that can learn and improve over time.
  - Create life forms that can build and use tools.
  - Create life forms that can build and use weapons.
  - Create life forms that can build and use structures.
  - Create life forms that can build and use machines.
