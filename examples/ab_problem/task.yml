prompt: >
  A::B is a system with 4 tokens: `A#`, `#A`, `B#` and `#B`.

  An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

  To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing
    
  In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other, they must be rewritten according to 
  the corresponding rule. For example, the first example shown here is computed as:

    B# A# #B #A B# =
    B# #B A# #A B# =
    A# #A B# =
    B#

  The steps were:

  1. We replaced `A# #B` by `#B A#`. 
  2. We replaced `B# #B` by nothing. 
  3. We replaced `A# #A` by nothing. 
  The final result was just `B#`.
  
  Now, consider the following program:
  
  $program
  
  Fully compute it, step by step and then submit the final result.

guidance:
  - Do NOT submit the steps, ONLY the final solution.
  - At the end of your reasoning process, ALWAYS use the `provide_solution` tool to submit the final result.
