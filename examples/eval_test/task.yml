# An evaluator is a command line that receives the current state of the agent via standard input 
# and performs some evaluation, at the end of which it can:
# 
# 1. Exit with a 42 status code if the task is completed successfully.
# 2. Exit with any other status code if the task is not completed successfully.
# 3. Return via stdout anything, that'll go to the chat history itself.
evaluator: 
  command:
    - python3
    - eval.py

# tools are not needed here, the evaluator will just check the chat history

# tool_box:
#   - name: Solve
#     description: You will use these actions to provide the answer to the problem.
#     tools:
#       - name: solution
#         description: "To provide the answer to the problem:"
#         example_payload: foobar
#         # if no tool is provided, the input payload will be returned as the output
#         # so that the evaluation can be done by inspecting the chat history
