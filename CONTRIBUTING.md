# How to contribute to Nerve

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your support means a lot. Here are some guidelines to help you get started and make the most meaningful impact on the project.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **command line** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Nerve will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change [as a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve/issues/new).

* After collecting positive feedback about the change on GitHub, start writing code :D

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Nerve in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/btZpkp45gQ).
